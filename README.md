# README

Share My Bike is a Rails web application, with Facebook authentication and BCrypt password encryption. On Share My Bike you can browse through cities and neighborhoods and view bicycles that are available to rent. The goal is that you rent a bicycle from someone just like yourself in a city or country that you are visiting. This way, you do not pollute, you can easily explore the area you are in, and you get to meet locals when getting your bike!

You can read the blog post I wrote about this app <a href="https://chadeyrasal.github.io/share_my_bike_a_rails_project">here</a>
